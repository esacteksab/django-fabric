Some assumptions 
================

These are based on my workflow/project layout. 

* Nginx's root is in `/usr/share/nginx`
* Each project exists in `/usr/share/nginx/$PROJECT`
* My virtualenv (`venv`) is located in `$PROJECT/venv`
* Files are being served by `www-data:www-data` (this needs to change)

Based on the above, I think the rest will make sense.
